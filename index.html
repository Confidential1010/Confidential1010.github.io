          <h3>What is Zika?</h3>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="grid_8 preffix_2">
              <div class="st1">Zika virus disease (Zika) is a disease caused by Zika virus that is spread to people primarily through the bite of an infected Aedes species mosquito. The most common symptoms of Zika are fever, rash, joint pain, and conjunctivitis (red eyes). The illness is usually mild with symptoms lasting for several days to a week after being bitten by an infected mosquito. People usually don’t get sick enough to go to the hospital, and they very rarely die of Zika. For this reason, many people might not realize they have been infected. Once a person has been infected, he or she is likely to be protected from future infections. Zika virus was first discovered in 1947 and is named after the Zika forest in Uganda. In 1952, the first human cases of Zika were detected and since then, outbreaks of Zika have been reported in tropical Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Islands. Zika outbreaks have probably occurred in many locations. Before 2007, at least 14 cases of Zika had been documented, although other cases were likely to have occurred and were not reported. Because the symptoms of Zika are similar to those of many other diseases, many cases may not have been recognized. In May 2015, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) issued an alert regarding the first confirmed Zika virus infection in Brazil and on Feb 1, 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared Zika virus a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). Local transmission has been reported in many other countries and territories. Zika virus likely will continue to spread to new areas. Zika is a disease that is caused by a muisquito. When bitten you can get headaches, rashes and even high fever. This disease is hard to be caught in someones body earlier and this disease is often confused with dengue fever. This disease can affect the children of pregnant woman because when bitten, it distorts the babies head by a lot, therefore the baby has a smaller head, and a smaller brain. Many babies die right after they come out into this world due to his disease. Doctors are desperatley trying to find a vaccine for the disease but they haven't found one yet.</div>

            	The scramble to slow the spread of Zika points to a larger problem: Epidemics move faster than global institutions. There are no vaccines for many of the world’s largest health threats in part because it isn’t a very lucrative business. Epidemics are unpredictable, making for an uncertain revenue stream, and often erupt in poor parts of the world. Health officials are aware that current research and development processes are ill-suited for epidemic diseases and have begun working on changes in the wake of the Ebola crisis.
